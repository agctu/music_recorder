# What is this?

I love video games with which I spent my teenage years. And the I love the music in them and many other kind of music. I'm not good at any instruments, but I sometimes like to play music, which is a kind of enjoyment for me. So I have this reposity to store my records here, which can be recorded and replayed with a keyboard implemented with javascript and html. So I can have fun with my laptop alone.
